The plan should identify the critical assets and functions. The plan should be tested to ensure plan effectiveness during a cyberattack.

<b>Business Impact Analysis (BIA):</b> An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. The BIA quantifies the impacts of disruptions on service delivery, risks to service delivery, and recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). These recovery requirements are then used to develop strategies, solutions, and plans. NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1

<b>Byte:</b> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. A byte can be represented as a character such as a number, letter or symbol.

## C

<b>Ciphertext:</b> The secret altered form of a plaintext. It’s encrypted and unreadable output that is produced by an encryption algorithm. The original data is unreadable by unauthorized users without the appropriate key.

<b>Classification:</b> Classification refers to the process of categorizing and assigning a level of sensitivity or importance to data, systems, or information assets based on their value and the potential impact of their compromise. It is focused on maintaining the confidentiality of the data, based on the data sensitivity.

<b>Classified or Sensitive Information:</b> Information that has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status and classification level when in documentary form. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance and need to know.

<b>Cloud computing:</b> Cloud computing is a technology model that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services, over the internet. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for individuals and organizations by outsourcing computing infrastructure and services to third-party providers.

<b>Confidentiality:</b> Refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. A fundamental aspect of information security, and it is often achieved through encryption, access controls, secure communication channels, and other measures designed to safeguard the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

<b>Community cloud:</b> A type of cloud computing deployment model where computing resources and infrastructure are shared by several organizations with common interests, such as similar security, compliance, or regulatory requirements. It provides a balance between the customization of a private cloud and the shared resources of a public cloud, making it suitable for a specific community or industry.

<b>Configuration management:</b> Organized process of managing and controlling changes to an organization's hardware, software, and network settings. This involves documentation, version control, and monitoring to mitigate vulnerabilities and promptly address unauthorized changes. A process to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated.

<b>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED):</b> Is an approach that seeks to reduce crime and enhance safety by strategically designing the physical environment which emphasizes passive features to discourage criminal activity and promote a sense of security.

<b>Criticality:</b> A measure of how important a system or data is to an organization's mission or business function. The concept of criticality helps prioritize resources and efforts based on the potential impact of a security breach or compromise. Critical systems or assets are those whose compromise could have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive information or overall business operations. 

<b>Cryptanalyst:</b> An expert that analyzes and breaks codes and ciphers used in cryptography. Their work is crucial for both designing secure cryptographic systems and identifying weaknesses in existing ones.

<b>Cryptography:</b> The science and practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes and ciphers. The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data in various communication and storage systems.

## D

<b>Data Integrity:</b> Information remains accurate and unchanged, preventing errors or unauthorized modifications. Checksums and validation processes are used to maintain the reliability of data in storage and data in transit.

<b>Data Loss Prevention (DLP):</b> System capabilities designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of information.

<b>Decryption:</b> Reversed form of encryption. Converting an encrypted “coded message” back into plaintext. Only the person with the correct key can decrypt the message. Deciphering is used interchangeably with decryption.

<b>De-encapsulation:</b> The opposite process of encapsulation. Collections of data are unpacked.

<b>Defense in Depth:</b> Strategy that uses a combination of technical, procedural, and organizational controls to create barriers at each layer. The aim is to create a more resilient defense against potential risks.

<b>Degaussing:</b> A technique of giving a device a magnetic reset. It erases or reduces the magnetic remanence so that no data is left behind or can be restored. Data can be on disk, tape, and video tapes.

<b>Denial-of-Service (DoS):</b> Prevention of any access to resources whether authorized or not. The prevention can come in a way of slowing down access as well. Imagine a system being offline when it should be online or a website loading extremely slow or not at all.

<b>Digital Signature:</b> A virtual stamp that shows a document or message has not been altered, is in its original state, and is from a specific person.When implemented, it can ensure authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

<b>Disaster Recovery (DR):</b> Involves strategies and backups in place to quickly get things back to normal, such as restoring important data and making sure systems can keep running. A disaster is when an organization’s critical business functions cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption.

<b>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):</b> The backup plan for when something bad happens. The processes, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of critical business functions and infrastructure systems. Goal is to make sure that systems can keep running in times of emergency.

<b>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</b> Security model that allows an owner or authorized users to 
decide who can access specific files, folders, or data based on user discretion, granting or restricting permissions as needed. It provides a decentralized approach to access management, giving users a level of autonomy over their own resources within a computer system.

<b>Domain Name Service (DNS):</b> Is the phone book for the internet. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. It is a crucial system applied to a service, a physical server and a network protocol. Using those three, the way we navigate the internet is simplified. www.google.com could translate to  8.8.8.8. You remember google.com much easier than 8.8.8.8

## E

<b>Egress Monitoring:</b> Includes the monitoring and analyzing the outgoing network traffic from an organization's internal network to external destinations. The purpose of the monitoring is to identify and investigate suspicious or anomalous patterns in outbound network traffic. It helps in preventing data breaches, intellectual property theft, or any unauthorized communication with malicious entities outside the network. Monitoring uses security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

<b>Encapsulation:</b> In cybersecurity, encapsulation is very important. In the OSI and TCP/IP model the packet structure ensures that data is organized into a standardized format, including headers and trailers. The structure helps routers, switches, and other network devices understand and process the information. Security protocols use encapsulation to protect data during transmission. For example, in VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), data is encapsulated within a secure tunnel, adding an extra layer of protection. In the layered security approach, different layers of the network stack handle specific aspects of communication, allowing for modular design and flexibility in security implementations.Some processes include mechanisms for verifying the integrity of the encapsulated data. This ensures that the data remains unchanged during transit.

<b>Encrypt:</b> The conversion of data from a readable format to an unreadable format. It could only be ready by someone authorized.

<b>Encryption:</b> The process and act of converting the message from its plaintext to ciphertext. 
Fundamental technique that uses cryptographic keys and algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of data.The primary goal of encryption is to protect data from unauthorized access or interception by making it unintelligible to anyone without the appropriate decryption key. Examples of data that needs encrypting are personal data, financial transactions, and classified communications.

<b>Encryption System:</b> Crucial for safeguarding sensitive information in various applications. The system is a combination of algorithms, processes, hardware, software, and procedures that provide encryption and decryption. Common encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple DES (3DES), and RSA. Effective encryption systems require secure key management practices. This involves the generation, distribution, storage, and rotation of cryptographic keys used in the encryption and decryption processes.

<b>Event:</b> Any observable occurrence in a network or system. They encompass a wide range of activities, such as user logins, system processes, network connections, or changes in configuration. Events play a crucial role in monitoring and incident response, allowing security professionals to detect, investigate, and respond to potential security incidents in real-time.

<b>Exploit:</b> An exploit refers to a piece of software, code, or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a computer system, software application, or network to compromise its security. Exploits are typically used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or perform other actions that can lead to the compromise of a system's confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

## F
<b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</b> Fundamental network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. FTP operates on a client-server model, where one computer acts as the server, hosting files, and another computer (or multiple computers) acts as the client, requesting and transferring files. It operates in two modes - the command mode for sending commands from the client to the server and the data transfer mode for actual file transfers. FTP supports various methods of authentication, including username and password. However, FTP by itself does not encrypt authentication information, making it vulnerable to security risks. Secure variants like FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) address these security concerns. FTP uses a command port, port 21 for sending commands and a data port for transferring files. Some FTP servers allow anonymous access, where users can log in with the username "anonymous" and use their email address as the password to access publicly available files.

<b>Fragment attack:</b> A fragment attack is a type of network-layer attack that involves manipulating or exploiting the fragmentation mechanism in network protocols. The goal of a fragment attack is to evade detection, inspection, or filtering mechanisms by dividing malicious payloads into smaller fragments during transmission making it harder for security mechanisms to analyze the entire content in one inspection. This can involve altering the order of fragments, overlapping them, or inserting malicious payloads in specific fragments. Mitigating fragment attacks involves implementing security measures that can handle and inspect fragmented packets effectively. This may include configuring firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to properly handle fragment reassembly, and ensuring that the network infrastructure is resilient against manipulation of packet fragments.

## G

<b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</b> A comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU). It strengthens and unifies data protection for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA. By design, privacy is by default. It was deemed an individual human right. These rights include the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict the processing of their data. Organizations must have a lawful basis for processing personal data. Organizations are obligated to report certain types of data breaches to authorities and individuals. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for non-compliance.

<b>Governance:</b> In cybersecurity, governance plays a crucial role in establishing policies, procedures, and controls to safeguard information assets. Policies cover areas such as data protection, access controls, incident response, and compliance. There are frameworks that include risk management processes to ensure that potential threats are proactively addressed to protect the organization's assets. Compliance ensures the company abides by relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. This includes data protection regulations, such as GDPR, and industry-specific standards like ISO 27001 for information security. Effective cybersecurity governance ensures that an organization's security efforts are well-coordinated, aligned with business objectives, and capable of adapting to evolving threats and technologies.

## H

<b>Hardening:</b>  In cybersecurity, hardening refers to securing the system, network, hardware, and software by reducing its vulnerabilities to reduce the attack surface. The goal is to make it as challenging as possible for attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system(s). Hardening is an ongoing process that requires review and adjustment to follow industry guidelines (Center for Internet Security). In configuration management, the settings are changed to eliminate unnecessary services, close unused ports, and install patches to apply best security patches. Access control is critical for hardening and the principle of least privilege is used to restrict user permissions. Physical security is also a concern so restricting access to sensitive areas such as server rooms, data centers, is just as important as preventative measures such as surveillance systems and physical locks on equipment. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can identify and remediate weaknesses.

<b>Hardware:</b> Physical components of devices and information technology systems. These components include electronic circuits, processors, memory modules, storage devices, networking equipment, and other tangible elements that make up a computer system. Hardware plays a critical role in the overall security. Vulnerabilities at the hardware level can have significant consequences for data confidentiality, integrity, and system functionality.

<b>Hash Function:</b> A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input and produces a fixed-size hash value (digest). The primary purpose is to generate a unique hash for each unique input. Changes to the data will result in a different hash value. A hash function will always produce the same output. This is crucial for consistency and reliability. Storing passwords in hashed form rather than plaintext enhances security by preventing the exposure of user passwords even when the hash values are compromised. Common hash lengths include 128-bit, 256-bit, or 512-bit hashes.

<b>Hashing:</b> The process of using a mathematical algorithm against data to produce a value that is representative of that data. It helps ensure data integrity, security, and efficiency. Calculating the hash of data before and after transmission or storage, one can compare the two hash values. If they match, the data is likely unchanged. If they don’t match, there may have been a change. Common hash functions include MD5 (Message Digest 5), SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), SHA-256, and SHA-3. SHA-256 and SHA-3 are more commonly used for secure applications.

<b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):</b> U.S. federal law that is the most important healthcare information regulation established in 1996. HIPAA consists of several components, with the two main rules being the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule establishes national standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It grants patients the right to specify how their data can be used and disclosed. The Security Rule sets standards for the security of electronic protected health information (ePHI). It is mandated that a Security Officer is appointed along with administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. Failure to comply with HIPAA can result in severe penalties, including fines and legal consequences.

<b>Hybrid cloud:</b> A computing environment that combines elements of both public and private clouds. In a hybrid cloud model, organizations can leverage the benefits of both on-premises infrastructure (private cloud) and resources provided by external cloud service providers (public cloud). This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and the ability to optimize infrastructure based on specific needs and requirements. This often involves using virtual private networks (VPNs), dedicated connections, or hybrid cloud management platforms. Organizations can optimize costs by leveraging public cloud resources for temporary workloads while maintaining essential functions on private infrastructure. The architecture provides organizations with robust disaster recovery and business continuity options.

## I
<b>Incident:</b> An event that has potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an organization’s system. Incidents can range from minor breaches to major events that require an appropriate response to mitigate damage. There are several types of incidents such as: security breaches, malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, insider threats, and phishing attacks. 

<b>Incident Handling:</b> Proper handling of events is essential for maintaining security and trustworthiness of an organization. Mitigations are guided by security policies and recommended practices. Organizations have procedures for reporting promptly to stakeholders, regulatory authorities, law enforcement, and customers. Timely and transparent communication is essential following an incident.

<b>Incident Response (IR):</b> The structured approach to managing and mitigating security incidents or breaches. The goal is to detect, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from incidents and breaches to protect and reduce damage. Effective incident response is key for reducing the impact of incidents and maintaining resilience of the organization's security posture.

<b>Incident Response Plan (IRP):</b> A structured and organized approach that outlines the procedures that should be followed when responding and managing an incident. The plan needs to describe the purpose and scope. The roles of the response team are defined, the incident is classified, the response procedures are detailed, and the communication procedures are outlined. Regular testing and updating the plan helps ensure its effectiveness. A well defined and tested incident response plan is critical for a robust cybersecurity strategy. 

<b>Ingress Monitoring:</b> Is the practice of actively monitoring and analyzing incoming network traffic.
The goal is to identify and respond to potential security threats or anomalies. 
Monitoring of incoming network traffic. The monitoring is important for a layered security strategy that allows organizations to proactively identify and respond to threats before they cause harm. 

<b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b>Cloud computing model that allows organizations to outsource their infrastructure needs. It provides virtualized resources over the internet. A 3rd party service delivers infrastructure to users. The resources can be managed on a pay-as-you-go basis allowing them to customize their service to scale and be more flexible. IaaS is popular in the data center where software and servers are purchased as a fully outsourced service. Popular providers of IaaS are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud

<b>Impact:</b> The impact refers to the potential harm that may result from a security incident. It assesses the severity of the incident on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

<b>Information Security Risk:</b> The potential harm that may be caused by vulnerabilities and threats to an organization’s systems. The risk also includes the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited.

<b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers:</b> IEEE is a global professional organization that is the leading authority in electrical engineering, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, and related fields. They help develop and publish industry standards and provide a platform for professionals to share knowledge.

<b>Integrity:</b> Integrity means that data has stayed the same as when it was created. Checksums can be used to verify the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data. Changes to the data will result in a different checksum.

<b>International Organization of Standards (ISO):</b> Non-governmental international standard setting organization that develops and publishes voluntary international standards. The ISO covers a wide range of industries and provides specifications for products, services, and systems to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency.

<b>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF):</b> A large open international community, made up of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers, that defines protocol standards (e.g., IP, TCP, DNS) through a process of collaboration and consensus. Its work is foundational to the growth of the modern internet.

<b>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):</b> Is a network layer protocol that is a critical part for the Internet Protocol. It is used to send operational information and error messages about a network condition. It’s mostly used for diagnostics and troubleshooting. Standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) through RFC 792.

<b>Internet Protocol (IPv4):</b> The most widely used version of Internet Protocol. The standard for the transmission of data from source to destination in a network. It utilizes a 32 bit addressing scheme. There can be nearly 4.3 billion unique addresses. The addresses are represented as 4 sets of decimal numbers with dots as the separators. Eg: 192.168.1.0

<b>Intrusion:</b> A security event(s) where a threat actor was successful in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or physical locations. Intrusions can take many forms such as malware attacks, phishing, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

<b>Likelihood:</b> The probability that an event, outcome, vulnerability will happen or be exploited. 

<b>Likelihood of Occurrence:</b> It is a measure of the probability that a particular occurrence will happen within a given time frame or under specific conditions. The likelihood is used to determine the level of risk associated with vulnerabilities.

<b>Linux:</b> An open-source, Unix-like operating system that serves as the core of various operating systems. It is open source, meaning that anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code base. A large community is available to support and have helped with the adoption. Developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

<b>Logging:</b> refers to the process of recording events and activities about operations, applications, networks, and security in a systematic manner. Logs provide a chronological record that is valuable for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes. Logging managed correctly helps with efficiency, security and compliance within organizations. Some of the common tools are Syslog, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, and Graylog.

<b>Log Anomaly:</b> A log anomaly refers to an unusual pattern/behavior that is detected in log data. Anomalies may indicate potential security threats or malfunctions. They require additional investigation to reveal any underlying risks. There are different types of anomalies such as: unusual access patterns, abnormal network traffic, application errors, system resource usage, security incidents.

<b>Logical Access Control Systems:</b> Security measures designed to restrict digital access to data, systems, and networks. Only authorized individuals have access to the systems and sensitive information. A logical access control system requires the validation of identity by using a PIN, card, or biometric token. The implementation of the control systems is critical for maintaining data security and compliance. 

## M
<b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</b> A security mechanism that is a vital component of a comprehensive security strategy. It is an effective defense against unauthorized access that adds an extra layer of security on top of an authentication that requires a username and password. It uses two or more distinct factors of authentication for identity verification. The factors could be, something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are, something you do. As threats continue to evolve, MFA continues to help mitigate risks with compromised credentials.

<b>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</b> Security model that restricts access to system resources based on security policies and classifications. MAC is enforced by the operating system and sets access controls that users cannot override because of the strict hierarchy of access privileges. When the protection of sensitive and classified information is important, MAC is a great choice. 

<b>Mantrap:</b> A physical security control that restricts unauthorized access to a secure area. It requires people to pass through two doors with only one door open at a time. Tailgating is the primary threat that is prevented which is why it is used in data centers, secure facilities, or areas with sensitive information. The mantrap uses two interlocking doors, integration with building security systems, access control system integration, sensors, timeout and lockdown, and security personnel.

<b>Message Digest:</b> Fundamental for security that provides a way to verify data integrity, securely store passwords, and support various cryptographic applications. A message digest is a hash, a digital signature, that uniquely identifies data and a change in any way, creates a completely distinct hash.

<b>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):</b> An attack where an unauthorized third party inserts themself in the communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. Once the attacker has access, they can eavesdrop on the communication, alter data in transit, and impersonate either party. Man-in-the-middle attacks are also sometimes referred to as On-path attacks. They are a significant threat to confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Mitigating the risk of MITM attacks, can be done with implementing a combination of technical safeguards, secure practices, and user education.

<b>Microsegmentation:</b> Security strategy that divides an organization's network into very small and highly localized zones. The division of the network helps make lateral movement in a security breach very difficult because each zone does not allow connection to other zones because they are isolated. It is part of a least privilege and a zero trust strategy that can implement a firewall at every connection point.

## N
<b>National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST):</b> Is a United States government agency that is responsible for developing and promoting measurement standards, advancing technology, and enhancing economic competitiveness. The standards have a broad impact, influencing industries, regulatory frameworks, and information security within the Computer Security Resource Center of the Computer Security Divisions. 

<b>Non-repudiation:</b> A concept in information security that ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity or integrity of communications. The implementation relies on cryptographic techniques, secure key management, and adherence to regular requirements. In short, someone cannot say that they did not send something because there is a digital signature. Organizations implement non-repudiation where accountability and integrity are required. The key components are digital signatures, public key infrastructure, timestamps, audit trails, and biometrics.
