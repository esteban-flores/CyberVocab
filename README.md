<b>Adequate Security:</b>  means security protections commensurate with the risk resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. This includes ensuring that information hosted on behalf of an agency and information systems and applications used by the agency operate effectively and provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections through the application of cost-effective security controls. Source: OMB Circular A-130

<b>Administrative Controls:</b> Controls implemented through policy and procedures. Examples: access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a specific operation (Dual Control). Administrative controls in modern environments are often enforced in conjunction with physical and/or technical controls, such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and approval by the hiring manager (Restricted Access).

<b>Adverse Events:</b> Events with a negative consequence, such as hacking of systems and data, system crashes, network packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, insider sensitive data theft, execution of malicious code that destroys systems and data.

<b>Business Continuity Plan (BCP):</b> The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe how an organization’s mission/business processes will be sustained during and after a significant disruption. The plan should identify the critical assets and functions. The plan should be tested to ensure plan effectiveness during a cyberattack.

<b>Business Impact Analysis (BIA):</b> An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. The BIA quantifies the impacts of disruptions on service delivery, risks to service delivery, and recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). These recovery requirements are then used to develop strategies, solutions, and plans. NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1

<b>Byte:</b> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. A byte can be represented as a character such as a number, letter or symbol.

## C

<b>Ciphertext:</b> The secret altered form of a plaintext. It’s encrypted and unreadable output that is produced by an encryption algorithm. The original data is unreadable by unauthorized users without the appropriate key.

<b>Classification:</b> Classification refers to the process of categorizing and assigning a level of sensitivity or importance to data, systems, or information assets based on their value and the potential impact of their compromise. It is focused on maintaining the confidentiality of the data, based on the data sensitivity.

<b>Classified or Sensitive Information:</b> Information that has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status and classification level when in documentary form. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance and need to know.

<b>Cloud computing:</b> Cloud computing is a technology model that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services, over the internet. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for individuals and organizations by outsourcing computing infrastructure and services to third-party providers.

<b>Confidentiality:</b> Refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. A fundamental aspect of information security, and it is often achieved through encryption, access controls, secure communication channels, and other measures designed to safeguard the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

<b>Community cloud:</b> A type of cloud computing deployment model where computing resources and infrastructure are shared by several organizations with common interests, such as similar security, compliance, or regulatory requirements. It provides a balance between the customization of a private cloud and the shared resources of a public cloud, making it suitable for a specific community or industry.

<b>Configuration management:</b> Organized process of managing and controlling changes to an organization's hardware, software, and network settings. This involves documentation, version control, and monitoring to mitigate vulnerabilities and promptly address unauthorized changes. A process to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated.

<b>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED):</b> Is an approach that seeks to reduce crime and enhance safety by strategically designing the physical environment which emphasizes passive features to discourage criminal activity and promote a sense of security.

<b>Criticality:</b> A measure of how important a system or data is to an organization's mission or business function. The concept of criticality helps prioritize resources and efforts based on the potential impact of a security breach or compromise. Critical systems or assets are those whose compromise could have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive information or overall business operations. 

<b>Cryptanalyst:</b> An expert that analyzes and breaks codes and ciphers used in cryptography. Their work is crucial for both designing secure cryptographic systems and identifying weaknesses in existing ones.

<b>Cryptography:</b> The science and practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes and ciphers. The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data in various communication and storage systems.

## D

<b>Data Integrity:</b> Information remains accurate and unchanged, preventing errors or unauthorized modifications. Checksums and validation processes are used to maintain the reliability of data in storage and data in transit.

<b>Data Loss Prevention (DLP):</b> System capabilities designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of information.

<b>Decryption:</b> Reversed form of encryption. Converting an encrypted “coded message” back into plaintext. Only the person with the correct key can decrypt the message. Deciphering is used interchangeably with decryption.

<b>De-encapsulation:</b> The opposite process of encapsulation. Collections of data are unpacked.

<b>Defense in Depth:</b> Strategy that uses a combination of technical, procedural, and organizational controls to create barriers at each layer. The aim is to create a more resilient defense against potential risks.

<b>Degaussing:</b> A technique of giving a device a magnetic reset. It erases or reduces the magnetic remanence so that no data is left behind or can be restored. Data can be on disk, tape, and video tapes.

<b>Denial-of-Service (DoS):</b> Prevention of any access to resources whether authorized or not. The prevention can come in a way of slowing down access as well. Imagine a system being offline when it should be online or a website loading extremely slow or not at all.

<b>Digital Signature:</b> A virtual stamp that shows a document or message has not been altered, is in its original state, and is from a specific person.When implemented, it can ensure authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

<b>Disaster Recovery (DR):</b> Involves strategies and backups in place to quickly get things back to normal, such as restoring important data and making sure systems can keep running. A disaster is when an organization’s critical business functions cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption.

<b>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):</b> The backup plan for when something bad happens. The processes, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of critical business functions and infrastructure systems. Goal is to make sure that systems can keep running in times of emergency.

<b>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</b> Security model that allows an owner or authorized users to 
decide who can access specific files, folders, or data based on user discretion, granting or restricting permissions as needed. It provides a decentralized approach to access management, giving users a level of autonomy over their own resources within a computer system.

<b>Domain Name Service (DNS):</b> Is the phone book for the internet. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. It is a crucial system applied to a service, a physical server and a network protocol. Using those three, the way we navigate the internet is simplified. www.google.com could translate to  8.8.8.8. You remember google.com much easier than 8.8.8.8

## E

<b>Egress Monitoring:</b> Includes the monitoring and analyzing the outgoing network traffic from an organization's internal network to external destinations. The purpose of the monitoring is to identify and investigate suspicious or anomalous patterns in outbound network traffic. It helps in preventing data breaches, intellectual property theft, or any unauthorized communication with malicious entities outside the network. Monitoring uses security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

<b>Encapsulation:</b> In cybersecurity, encapsulation is very important. In the OSI and TCP/IP model the packet structure ensures that data is organized into a standardized format, including headers and trailers. The structure helps routers, switches, and other network devices understand and process the information. Security protocols use encapsulation to protect data during transmission. For example, in VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), data is encapsulated within a secure tunnel, adding an extra layer of protection. In the layered security approach, different layers of the network stack handle specific aspects of communication, allowing for modular design and flexibility in security implementations.Some processes include mechanisms for verifying the integrity of the encapsulated data. This ensures that the data remains unchanged during transit.

<b>Encrypt:</b> The conversion of data from a readable format to an unreadable format. It could only be ready by someone authorized.

<b>Encryption:</b> The process and act of converting the message from its plaintext to ciphertext. 
Fundamental technique that uses cryptographic keys and algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of data.The primary goal of encryption is to protect data from unauthorized access or interception by making it unintelligible to anyone without the appropriate decryption key. Examples of data that needs encrypting are personal data, financial transactions, and classified communications.

<b>Encryption System:</b> Crucial for safeguarding sensitive information in various applications. The system is a combination of algorithms, processes, hardware, software, and procedures that provide encryption and decryption. Common encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple DES (3DES), and RSA. Effective encryption systems require secure key management practices. This involves the generation, distribution, storage, and rotation of cryptographic keys used in the encryption and decryption processes.

<b>Event:</b> Any observable occurrence in a network or system. They encompass a wide range of activities, such as user logins, system processes, network connections, or changes in configuration. Events play a crucial role in monitoring and incident response, allowing security professionals to detect, investigate, and respond to potential security incidents in real-time.

<b>Exploit:</b> An exploit refers to a piece of software, code, or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a computer system, software application, or network to compromise its security. Exploits are typically used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or perform other actions that can lead to the compromise of a system's confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

## F
<b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</b> Fundamental network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. FTP operates on a client-server model, where one computer acts as the server, hosting files, and another computer (or multiple computers) acts as the client, requesting and transferring files. It operates in two modes - the command mode for sending commands from the client to the server and the data transfer mode for actual file transfers. FTP supports various methods of authentication, including username and password. However, FTP by itself does not encrypt authentication information, making it vulnerable to security risks. Secure variants like FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) address these security concerns. FTP uses a command port, port 21 for sending commands and a data port for transferring files. Some FTP servers allow anonymous access, where users can log in with the username "anonymous" and use their email address as the password to access publicly available files.

<b>Fragment attack:</b> A fragment attack is a type of network-layer attack that involves manipulating or exploiting the fragmentation mechanism in network protocols. The goal of a fragment attack is to evade detection, inspection, or filtering mechanisms by dividing malicious payloads into smaller fragments during transmission making it harder for security mechanisms to analyze the entire content in one inspection. This can involve altering the order of fragments, overlapping them, or inserting malicious payloads in specific fragments. Mitigating fragment attacks involves implementing security measures that can handle and inspect fragmented packets effectively. This may include configuring firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to properly handle fragment reassembly, and ensuring that the network infrastructure is resilient against manipulation of packet fragments.
