<b>Business Impact Analysis (BIA):</b> An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. The BIA quantifies the impacts of disruptions on service delivery, risks to service delivery, and recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). These recovery requirements are then used to develop strategies, solutions, and plans. NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1

<b>Byte:</b> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. A byte can be represented as a character such as a number, letter or symbol.

## C

<b>Ciphertext:</b> The secret altered form of a plaintext. It’s encrypted and unreadable output that is produced by an encryption algorithm. The original data is unreadable by unauthorized users without the appropriate key.

<b>Classification:</b> Classification refers to the process of categorizing and assigning a level of sensitivity or importance to data, systems, or information assets based on their value and the potential impact of their compromise. It is focused on maintaining the confidentiality of the data, based on the data sensitivity.

<b>Classified or Sensitive Information:</b> Information that has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status and classification level when in documentary form. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance and need to know.

<b>Cloud computing:</b> Cloud computing is a technology model that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services, over the internet. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for individuals and organizations by outsourcing computing infrastructure and services to third-party providers.

<b>Criticality:</b> A measure of how important a system or data is to an organization's mission or business function. The concept of criticality helps prioritize resources and efforts based on the potential impact of a security breach or compromise. Critical systems or assets are those whose compromise could have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive information or overall business operations. 

<b>Cryptanalyst:</b> An expert that analyzes and breaks codes and ciphers used in cryptography. Their work is crucial for both designing secure cryptographic systems and identifying weaknesses in existing ones.

<b>Cryptography:</b> The science and practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes and ciphers. The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data in various communication and storage systems.

## D

<b>Data Integrity:</b> Information remains accurate and unchanged, preventing errors or unauthorized modifications. Checksums and validation processes are used to maintain the reliability of data in storage and data in transit.

<b>Data Loss Prevention (DLP):</b> System capabilities designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of information.

<b>Decryption:</b> Reversed form of encryption. Converting an encrypted “coded message” back into plaintext. Only the person with the correct key can decrypt the message. Deciphering is used interchangeably with decryption.

<b>De-encapsulation:</b> The opposite process of encapsulation. Collections of data are unpacked.

<b>Defense in Depth:</b> Strategy that uses a combination of technical, procedural, and organizational controls to create barriers at each layer. The aim is to create a more resilient defense against potential risks.

<b>Degaussing:</b> A technique of giving a device a magnetic reset. It erases or reduces the magnetic remanence so that no data is left behind or can be restored. Data can be on disk, tape, and video tapes.

<b>Denial-of-Service (DoS):</b> Prevention of any access to resources whether authorized or not. The prevention can come in a way of slowing down access as well. Imagine a system being offline when it should be online or a website loading extremely slow or not at all.

<b>Digital Signature:</b> A virtual stamp that shows a document or message has not been altered, is in its original state, and is from a specific person.When implemented, it can ensure authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

<b>Disaster Recovery (DR):</b> Involves strategies and backups in place to quickly get things back to normal, such as restoring important data and making sure systems can keep running. A disaster is when an organization’s critical business functions cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption.

<b>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):</b> The backup plan for when something bad happens. The processes, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of critical business functions and infrastructure systems. Goal is to make sure that systems can keep running in times of emergency.

<b>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</b> Security model that allows an owner or authorized users to 
decide who can access specific files, folders, or data based on user discretion, granting or restricting permissions as needed. It provides a decentralized approach to access management, giving users a level of autonomy over their own resources within a computer system.

<b>Domain Name Service (DNS):</b> Is the phone book for the internet. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. It is a crucial system applied to a service, a physical server and a network protocol. Using those three, the way we navigate the internet is simplified. www.google.com could translate to  8.8.8.8. You remember google.com much easier than 8.8.8.8

## E

<b>Egress Monitoring:</b> Includes the monitoring and analyzing the outgoing network traffic from an organization's internal network to external destinations. The purpose of the monitoring is to identify and investigate suspicious or anomalous patterns in outbound network traffic. It helps in preventing data breaches, intellectual property theft, or any unauthorized communication with malicious entities outside the network. Monitoring uses security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

<b>Encapsulation:</b> In cybersecurity, encapsulation is very important. In the OSI and TCP/IP model the packet structure ensures that data is organized into a standardized format, including headers and trailers. The structure helps routers, switches, and other network devices understand and process the information. Security protocols use encapsulation to protect data during transmission. For example, in VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), data is encapsulated within a secure tunnel, adding an extra layer of protection. In the layered security approach, different layers of the network stack handle specific aspects of communication, allowing for modular design and flexibility in security implementations.Some processes include mechanisms for verifying the integrity of the encapsulated data. This ensures that the data remains unchanged during transit.

<b>Encrypt:</b> The conversion of data from a readable format to an unreadable format. It could only be ready by someone authorized.

<b>Encryption:</b> The process and act of converting the message from its plaintext to ciphertext. 
Fundamental technique that uses cryptographic keys and algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of data.The primary goal of encryption is to protect data from unauthorized access or interception by making it unintelligible to anyone without the appropriate decryption key. Examples of data that needs encrypting are personal data, financial transactions, and classified communications.

<b>Encryption System:</b> Crucial for safeguarding sensitive information in various applications. The system is a combination of algorithms, processes, hardware, software, and procedures that provide encryption and decryption. Common encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple DES (3DES), and RSA. Effective encryption systems require secure key management practices. This involves the generation, distribution, storage, and rotation of cryptographic keys used in the encryption and decryption processes.

<b>Event:</b> Any observable occurrence in a network or system. They encompass a wide range of activities, such as user logins, system processes, network connections, or changes in configuration. Events play a crucial role in monitoring and incident response, allowing security professionals to detect, investigate, and respond to potential security incidents in real-time.

<b>Exploit:</b> An exploit refers to a piece of software, code, or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a computer system, software application, or network to compromise its security. Exploits are typically used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or perform other actions that can lead to the compromise of a system's confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

## F
<b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</b> Fundamental network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. FTP operates on a client-server model, where one computer acts as the server, hosting files, and another computer (or multiple computers) acts as the client, requesting and transferring files. It operates in two modes - the command mode for sending commands from the client to the server and the data transfer mode for actual file transfers. FTP supports various methods of authentication, including username and password. However, FTP by itself does not encrypt authentication information, making it vulnerable to security risks. Secure variants like FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) address these security concerns. FTP uses a command port, port 21 for sending commands and a data port for transferring files. Some FTP servers allow anonymous access, where users can log in with the username "anonymous" and use their email address as the password to access publicly available files.

<b>Fragment attack:</b> A fragment attack is a type of network-layer attack that involves manipulating or exploiting the fragmentation mechanism in network protocols. The goal of a fragment attack is to evade detection, inspection, or filtering mechanisms by dividing malicious payloads into smaller fragments during transmission making it harder for security mechanisms to analyze the entire content in one inspection. This can involve altering the order of fragments, overlapping them, or inserting malicious payloads in specific fragments. Mitigating fragment attacks involves implementing security measures that can handle and inspect fragmented packets effectively. This may include configuring firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to properly handle fragment reassembly, and ensuring that the network infrastructure is resilient against manipulation of packet fragments.

## G

<b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</b> A comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU). It strengthens and unifies data protection for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA. By design, privacy is by default. It was deemed an individual human right. These rights include the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict the processing of their data. Organizations must have a lawful basis for processing personal data. Organizations are obligated to report certain types of data breaches to authorities and individuals. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for non-compliance.

<b>Governance:</b> In cybersecurity, governance plays a crucial role in establishing policies, procedures, and controls to safeguard information assets. Policies cover areas such as data protection, access controls, incident response, and compliance. There are frameworks that include risk management processes to ensure that potential threats are proactively addressed to protect the organization's assets. Compliance ensures the company abides by relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. This includes data protection regulations, such as GDPR, and industry-specific standards like ISO 27001 for information security. Effective cybersecurity governance ensures that an organization's security efforts are well-coordinated, aligned with business objectives, and capable of adapting to evolving threats and technologies.

## H

<b>Hardening:</b>  In cybersecurity, hardening refers to securing the system, network, hardware, and software by reducing its vulnerabilities to reduce the attack surface. The goal is to make it as challenging as possible for attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system(s). Hardening is an ongoing process that requires review and adjustment to follow industry guidelines (Center for Internet Security). In configuration management, the settings are changed to eliminate unnecessary services, close unused ports, and install patches to apply best security patches. Access control is critical for hardening and the principle of least privilege is used to restrict user permissions. Physical security is also a concern so restricting access to sensitive areas such as server rooms, data centers, is just as important as preventative measures such as surveillance systems and physical locks on equipment. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can identify and remediate weaknesses.

<b>Hardware:</b> Physical components of devices and information technology systems. These components include electronic circuits, processors, memory modules, storage devices, networking equipment, and other tangible elements that make up a computer system. Hardware plays a critical role in the overall security. Vulnerabilities at the hardware level can have significant consequences for data confidentiality, integrity, and system functionality.

<b>Hash Function:</b> A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input and produces a fixed-size hash value (digest). The primary purpose is to generate a unique hash for each unique input. Changes to the data will result in a different hash value. A hash function will always produce the same output. This is crucial for consistency and reliability. Storing passwords in hashed form rather than plaintext enhances security by preventing the exposure of user passwords even when the hash values are compromised. Common hash lengths include 128-bit, 256-bit, or 512-bit hashes.

<b>Hashing:</b> The process of using a mathematical algorithm against data to produce a value that is representative of that data. It helps ensure data integrity, security, and efficiency. Calculating the hash of data before and after transmission or storage, one can compare the two hash values. If they match, the data is likely unchanged. If they don’t match, there may have been a change. Common hash functions include MD5 (Message Digest 5), SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), SHA-256, and SHA-3. SHA-256 and SHA-3 are more commonly used for secure applications.

<b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):</b> U.S. federal law that is the most important healthcare information regulation established in 1996. HIPAA consists of several components, with the two main rules being the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule establishes national standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It grants patients the right to specify how their data can be used and disclosed. The Security Rule sets standards for the security of electronic protected health information (ePHI). It is mandated that a Security Officer is appointed along with administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. Failure to comply with HIPAA can result in severe penalties, including fines and legal consequences.

<b>Hybrid cloud:</b> A computing environment that combines elements of both public and private clouds. In a hybrid cloud model, organizations can leverage the benefits of both on-premises infrastructure (private cloud) and resources provided by external cloud service providers (public cloud). This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and the ability to optimize infrastructure based on specific needs and requirements. This often involves using virtual private networks (VPNs), dedicated connections, or hybrid cloud management platforms. Organizations can optimize costs by leveraging public cloud resources for temporary workloads while maintaining essential functions on private infrastructure. The architecture provides organizations with robust disaster recovery and business continuity options.

## I
<b>Incident:</b> An event that has potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an organization’s system. Incidents can range from minor breaches to major events that require an appropriate response to mitigate damage. There are several types of incidents such as: security breaches, malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, insider threats, and phishing attacks. 

<b>Incident Handling:</b> Proper handling of events is essential for maintaining security and trustworthiness of an organization. Mitigations are guided by security policies and recommended practices. Organizations have procedures for reporting promptly to stakeholders, regulatory authorities, law enforcement, and customers. Timely and transparent communication is essential following an incident.

<b>Incident Response (IR):</b> The structured approach to managing and mitigating security incidents or breaches. The goal is to detect, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from incidents and breaches to protect and reduce damage. Effective incident response is key for reducing the impact of incidents and maintaining resilience of the organization's security posture.

<b>Incident Response Plan (IRP):</b> A structured and organized approach that outlines the procedures that should be followed when responding and managing an incident. The plan needs to describe the purpose and scope. The roles of the response team are defined, the incident is classified, the response procedures are detailed, and the communication procedures are outlined. Regular testing and updating the plan helps ensure its effectiveness. A well defined and tested incident response plan is critical for a robust cybersecurity strategy. 

<b>Ingress Monitoring:</b> Is the practice of actively monitoring and analyzing incoming network traffic.
The goal is to identify and respond to potential security threats or anomalies. 
Monitoring of incoming network traffic. The monitoring is important for a layered security strategy that allows organizations to proactively identify and respond to threats before they cause harm. 

<b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b>Cloud computing model that allows organizations to outsource their infrastructure needs. It provides virtualized resources over the internet. A 3rd party service delivers infrastructure to users. The resources can be managed on a pay-as-you-go basis allowing them to customize their service to scale and be more flexible. IaaS is popular in the data center where software and servers are purchased as a fully outsourced service. Popular providers of IaaS are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud

<b>Impact:</b> The impact refers to the potential harm that may result from a security incident. It assesses the severity of the incident on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

They help develop and publish industry standards and provide a platform for professionals to share knowledge.

<b>Integrity:</b> Integrity means that data has stayed the same as when it was created. Checksums can be used to verify the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data. Changes to the data will result in a different checksum.

<b>International Organization of Standards (ISO):</b> Non-governmental international standard setting organization that develops and publishes voluntary international standards. The ISO covers a wide range of industries and provides specifications for products, services, and systems to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency.

<b>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF):</b> A large open international community, made up of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers, that defines protocol standards (e.g., IP, TCP, DNS) through a process of collaboration and consensus. Its work is foundational to the growth of the modern internet.

<b>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):</b> Is a network layer protocol that is a critical part for the Internet Protocol. It is used to send operational information and error messages about a network condition. It’s mostly used for diagnostics and troubleshooting. Standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) through RFC 792.

<b>Internet Protocol (IPv4):</b> The most widely used version of Internet Protocol. The standard for the transmission of data from source to destination in a network. It utilizes a 32 bit addressing scheme. There can be nearly 4.3 billion unique addresses. The addresses are represented as 4 sets of decimal numbers with dots as the separators. Eg: 192.168.1.0

<b>Intrusion:</b> A security event(s) where a threat actor was successful in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or physical locations. Intrusions can take many forms such as malware attacks, phishing, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

A large community is available to support and have helped with the adoption. Developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

<b>Logging:</b> refers to the process of recording events and activities about operations, applications, networks, and security in a systematic manner. Logs provide a chronological record that is valuable for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes. Logging managed correctly helps with efficiency, security and compliance within organizations. Some of the common tools are Syslog, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, and Graylog.

<b>Log Anomaly:</b> A log anomaly refers to an unusual pattern/behavior that is detected in log data. Anomalies may indicate potential security threats or malfunctions. They require additional investigation to reveal any underlying risks. There are different types of anomalies such as: unusual access patterns, abnormal network traffic, application errors, system resource usage, security incidents.

<b>Logical Access Control Systems:</b> Security measures designed to restrict digital access to data, systems, and networks. Only authorized individuals have access to the systems and sensitive information. A logical access control system requires the validation of identity by using a PIN, card, or biometric token. The implementation of the control systems is critical for maintaining data security and compliance. 

## M
<b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</b> A security mechanism that is a vital component of a comprehensive security strategy. It is an effective defense against unauthorized access that adds an extra layer of security on top of an authentication that requires a username and password. It uses two or more distinct factors of authentication for identity verification. The factors could be, something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are, something you do. As threats continue to evolve, MFA continues to help mitigate risks with compromised credentials.

<b>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</b> Security model that restricts access to system resources based on security policies and classifications. MAC is enforced by the operating system and sets access controls that users cannot override because of the strict hierarchy of access privileges. When the protection of sensitive and classified information is important, MAC is a great choice. 

<b>Mantrap:</b> A physical security control that restricts unauthorized access to a secure area. It requires people to pass through two doors with only one door open at a time. Tailgating is the primary threat that is prevented which is why it is used in data centers, secure facilities, or areas with sensitive information. The mantrap uses two interlocking doors, integration with building security systems, access control system integration, sensors, timeout and lockdown, and security personnel.

<b>Message Digest:</b> Fundamental for security that provides a way to verify data integrity, securely store passwords, and support various cryptographic applications. A message digest is a hash, a digital signature, that uniquely identifies data and a change in any way, creates a completely distinct hash.

<b>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):</b> An attack where an unauthorized third party inserts themself in the communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. Once the attacker has access, they can eavesdrop on the communication, alter data in transit, and impersonate either party. Man-in-the-middle attacks are also sometimes referred to as On-path attacks. They are a significant threat to confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Mitigating the risk of MITM attacks, can be done with implementing a combination of technical safeguards, secure practices, and user education.

<b>Microsegmentation:</b> Security strategy that divides an organization's network into very small and highly localized zones. The division of the network helps make lateral movement in a security breach very difficult because each zone does not allow connection to other zones because they are isolated. It is part of a least privilege and a zero trust strategy that can implement a firewall at every connection point.

## N
<b>National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST):</b> Is a United States government agency that is responsible for developing and promoting measurement standards, advancing technology, and enhancing economic competitiveness. The standards have a broad impact, influencing industries, regulatory frameworks, and information security within the Computer Security Resource Center of the Computer Security Divisions. 

<b>Non-repudiation:</b> A concept in information security that ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity or integrity of communications. The implementation relies on cryptographic techniques, secure key management, and adherence to regular requirements. In short, someone cannot say that they did not send something because there is a digital signature. Organizations implement non-repudiation where accountability and integrity are required. The key components are digital signatures, public key infrastructure, timestamps, audit trails, and biometrics.

## O
<b>Object:</b> An object is many things depending on the context. In cybersecurity,  it is things like devices, files, records, tables, processes, programs, apps, and domains. If you have access to an object that means that you have access to the information contained inside.

<b>Operating System (OS):</b> The software that runs the device after it powers on. After the bios loads, the operating system is the first program loaded. The kernel is the main part of the OS that is in memory at all times. The operating system controls all of the other programs (such as the Web server) that run in the computer. 

<b>Oversized Packet Attack:</b> In network security, oversized packets are associated with various issues, vulnerabilities, or attacks. A network packet that is larger than expected is sent and cannot be handled by the receiving system and it fails because of it.

## P
<b>Packet:</b> The building blocks of network communication. The packet is the representation of data of the OSI model layer 3. The packets are structured data blocks that contain the actual data to be sent and the control data. Each packet has three parts: header, data, and trailer. The control data is stored in the headers and contains the source, destination, and clocking information for transmission synchronization. The trailer contains the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that verifies the contents.

<b>Patch:</b> A patch is a software update that is designed to improve and fix a program. Patches can be released on a regular schedule or to address a vulnerability. The software modifies the files and device settings connected to the vulnerability. The regularly installed patches help keep software secure, stable, and up to date with the latest improvements.

<b>Patch Management:</b> Essential for maintaining system security, addressing vulnerabilities, and ensuring the stability and performance of applications. It involves planning, testing, deployment, patching, and security fixes across an organization's infrastructure. Patches are tested in a controlled development environment before deploying them on production servers.

<b>Payload:</b> In cybersecurity, a payload refers to malware that performs a malicious action. 
The primary action of a malicious code attack. The malicious code may cause damage, steal data, or grant unauthorized access.

<b>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):</b> A set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The key components are: build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly monitor and test networks, and maintain an information security policy. There are 4 levels of compliance. PCI DSS is crucial for protecting sensitive financial information and preventing unauthorized access to credit card data. It also helps reduce the risk of data breaches and financial losses associated with compromised cardholder information.

<b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</b> NIST in 800-122 outlines what is PII. It refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. Pieces of information are full name, social security number, date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, biometric information, medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Protection of PII is a legal requirement in most cases, and crucial for keeping trust high and protecting privacy.

<b>Physical Controls:</b> Security controls implemented to safeguard physical assets, resources, and IT infrastructure. Examples include walls, fences, locks, and some linked to technical and logical systems (badge readers). The controls are critical in an organization’s overall security strategy that help mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, theft, vandalism and other physical threats.

<b>Plaintext:</b> Readable and unencrypted form of data. The data could be a message that is in an unencrypted state, making it vulnerable to spying.

<!--
Platform as a Service (PaaS): The web-authoring or application development middleware environment that allows applications to be built in the cloud before they’re deployed as SaaS assets. 
-->

<b>Principle of Least Privilege:</b> A foundational security concept that forces the minimum level of access to individuals, systems, and processes to perform tasks. The goal is to reduce the attack surface by restricting privileges across the board. Also known as Principle of Minimal Privilege or Least Authority.

<b>Privacy:</b> A fundamental right of an individual to keep their personal information, activities, and communications confidential and free from spying or interference. Individuals control the distribution of the information. The landscape of privacy is constantly changing because of the changes in technologies and the increasing digitization of information.

<!--

Private cloud: The phrase used to describe a cloud computing platform that is implemented within the corporate firewall, under the control of the IT department. A private cloud is designed to offer the same features and benefits of cloud systems, but removes a number of objections to the cloud computing model, including control over enterprise and customer data, worries about security, and issues connected to regulatory compliance. 

-->

<b>Privileged Account:</b> An account with elevated access and permissions in a system, network, or application. Privileged accounts are typically admin accounts or are for special use. The management of the accounts are critical due to the potential security risks their access poses.

<b>Probability:</b> The measure of the likelihood that a specific event will happen. In cybersecurity, probability is the likelihood that a threat is capable of exploiting a vulnerability.

<b>Protected Health Information (PHI):</b> Is very similar to Protected Identifiable Information but for the healthcare sector. The identifiable information is related to an individual’s health status, medical conditions, healthcare services, and payment for healthcare services. PHI is very important to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

## Q
<b>Qualitative Risk Analysis:</b> A method that involves evaluating risks based on subjective judgements. It is used when there is a lack of precise quantifiable information available. The goal is to prioritize risks based on their impact and probability. It allows organizations to focus on managing the highest risks. The subjectivity is a limitation because it can introduce biases in risk assessments.

<b>Quantitative Risk Analysis:</b> A method that involves evaluating risks based on numerical data, models, and techniques to quantify and analyze the impact of risks. Quantitative risk analysis provides a precise understanding of the outcomes and financial losses. Projects and situations that require numerical precision and detailed modeling often have a quantitative risk analysis conducted. There are advantages to the analysis. It can offer a precise understanding of the impact of the risks. It helps provide informed decisions by quantifying risks. The simulation of scenarios helps the cost benefit analysis and prioritization of actions that maximize benefits. There are limitations to this analysis. There must be enough data otherwise an analysis cannot be conducted. It can be resource intensive for complex projects and situations. It relies on assumptions so dynamic environments increase the complexity making analysis less precise.

## R
<b>Ransomware:</b> A type of malicious software designed to encrypt files, lock computer systems until ransom money is paid. The devices and systems are not accessible to users until a decryption key is provided. Cryptocurrency is demanded in many of the ransomware cases. These types of attacks have severe consequences and cause data loss, financial loss, and business operational disruptions. Ransomware is an ever-evolving threat that requires a comprehensive approach to mitigate the risks associated with ransomware attacks.

<b>Records:</b> Evidence of activities performed or results (reports). They help verify that an organization’s systems are working as intended. Depending on the context, records could also be units in a form (data fields).

<b>Records Retention:</b> A systematic management of an organization’s documents and information. Policies and procedures will be established for the creation, storage, retrieval, preservation and disposal of records. Records will have a life cycle meaning that the organization will keep necessary information for an appropriate amount of time only before disposing of them. Retention and disposal ensures that organization’s only keep records for operational, legal, regulatory, or historical purposes. As the legal landscape evolves and laws change, records retention for organization’s will also adapt to stay compliant. 

<b>Remanence:</b> Refers to residual information that remains after magnetization or deletion on a storage media. Data remanence is a significant risk. Magnetic romance is used on hard disk drives, magnetic tapes, and other magnetic sensors.

<b>Request for change (RFC):</b> The first stage of change management. It is a formal document that is used to propose a change to a process, product, or project. The purpose of the RFC is to ensure that changes are well tested and do not impact operations in a negative way.

<b>Risk:</b> In general, risk refers to a potential for loss, harm, or adverse consequences. Risk is very important for decision making and strategic planning. Risk has two components. Probability and impact. In cyber security, risk refers to the potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, cyber attacks.

<b>Risk Acceptance:</b> A management strategy where an organization acknowledges the risk, understands the impact, and does not take any action to mitigate or transfer the risk. The determination of the benefits of the business function outweigh the risk and impact. 

<b>Risk Assessment:</b> The process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks that may impact objectives. The overall goal for the risk assessment is to provide organizations with a better understanding of their risks. The assessments allow for more informed decisions to better allocate resources, create strategies, and navigate unknowns. The assessments allow for better organizational resiliency and performance.

<b>Risk Avoidance:</b> Management strategy where an organization acts to eliminate risk(s) completely. The strategy is implemented when the impact or probability of a risk is too great to be offset by the benefits. The business function is avoided all together.

<b>Risk Management:</b> Finds the right balance between risk mitigation, risk acceptance, risk transfer based on the organization. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, evaluating and controlling threats to minimize the potential impact and maximize opportunities. Risk management includes all the phases of risk context (or frame), risk assessment, risk treatment and risk monitoring. There are several steps in management. Risk identification helps with identification of risks that affect objectives. Risk assessment’s evaluate the impact of risks and prioritizes their significance. Risk mitigation and response will develop strategies to respond to risks by avoiding, transferring, accepting, or mitigating. Monitoring and reviewing will help to keep strategies flexible based on changes in situations. Communication of risks and strategies is important to stakeholders.

<b>Risk Management Framework (RMF):</b> A structured process used by organizations to identify, assess, prioritize, and manage risks effectively. Ensures that risks are mitigated in a way that aligns with organizational objectives. There are many frameworks and the choice that an organization makes depends on its industry, objective, and regulatory requirements. Common risk management frameworks are: NIST Risk Management Framework, ISO 31000:2018, ISO 27001:2013, COSO Enterprise Risk Management, PMI Risk Management Framework.

<b>Risk Mitigation:</b> The process of taking actions to minimize the probability and impact of risks. The overall goal is to proactively address identified risks and limit their impact on the organization. Mitigation is an ongoing process that requires fine tuning to effectively address risks. A few examples of mitigation are risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk acceptance.

<b>Risk Tolerance:</b> Refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept for their objectives. It requires ongoing assessment, communication, and proactive approach to uncertainties. 

<b>Risk Transference:</b> Refers to shifting and/or sharing the risk. The organization shifts the financial consequences of a risk to another. It’s done with contracts, insurance, or other financial means. The overall goal is to transfer the financial burden to another that is able to handle it better. Risk transference relies heavily on the other organization to be financially prepared for the risk.

<b>Risk Treatment:</b> Involves the selection and implementation of strategies to address identified risks. The goal is to modify, mitigate, transfer, or accept risks that fits with the organization’s goal and risk tolerance.Treatment is an ongoing process that requires fine tuning and adaptation to changes with the organization's goals and circumstances.
Role-based access control (RBAC):  A security model that governs access to systems and resources based on a role set by an organization's administrator. This simplifies the access management and enhances security by forcing individuals to only have necessary permissions to do their jobs.

<b>Rule:</b> A security rule is an instruction that outlines how security controls should behave in an event. It will either allow or deny access to a system by comparing subjects to access control lists. For example, a firewall rule will dictate which network traffic is allowed or denied based on things like an IP address, port, and protocol.

## S
<b>Security Controls:</b> Measures to manage and mitigate risks, protect information, and ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems. Controls are critical for building a resilient cybersecurity posture. The controls can be categorized into many types based on purpose and functionality. There are preventive controls, detective controls, corrective controls, deterrent controls, compensating controls, directive controls, preemptive controls, and technical controls.

<b>Security Governance:</b> All of the policies, roles, and processes the organization uses to manage, direct, and control the security. Security governance is critical for an organization’s overall security posture and should adapt to changing threats.

<b>Security Operations Center (SOC):</b> A central unit that is responsible for monitoring, detecting, responding, and mitigating threats before the organization experiences disruptions. A SOC can be internal or external (manage service provider). The overall goal of a SOC is to enhance the security posture by providing real time visibility into an IT environment. 

<b>Segregation of Duties:</b> Also known as Separation of Duties. The goal is to establish check and balances within an organization to reduce the risk of fraud, errors, insider threats, and conflict of interest when one person has too much access and control. Segregation of duties is common in financial transactions, information systems, and internal controls. The segregation contributes to improved governance, risk management, and compliance.

<b>Sensitivity:</b> A measure of the level of confidentiality and importance for data. The level of how sensitive information is will directly impact how much protection is required. Data such as financial records and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) directly impacts lives and is considered highly sensitive. Sensitivity also refers to security threats, vulnerabilities, and the need to safeguard data and systems.

<b>Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP):</b> Standard communication protocol used for email. It works with other protocols such as POP3 and IMAP to send and receive emails. Since SMTP is the backbone for communication between email servers it has evolved over time. Some evolutions were the addition of encryption and authentication because the confidentiality and integrity of emails are critical.

<b>Single-Factor Authentication (SFA):</b> A security process where access is granted after presenting only one form of authentication. The three most used are something you know, something you have, and something you are. An example of Something you know is a username and password. Other authentications are fingerprint scans and smart cards. SFA is convenient but is considered less secure. It can be used in environments where the risk level is low. 

<b>Social engineering:</b> A form of manipulation and deception used to exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and resources. Social engineering attacks often exploit trust, authority, fear, or urgency to trick people into giving confidential information and performing actions that compromise security. Tactics that are common in this form of attack are email, phone, text, and social media.

<b>Software:</b> A set of instructions, programs, or data that enable computers and devices to perform specific tasks. The most important component of modern systems because devices do not function without software. Software security is becoming more and more important because many systems have vulnerabilities that are now able to be exploited.

<b>Software as a Service (SaaS):</b> A software model where applications are hosted by a third party and are accessible over the internet. The third party is a cloud provider and an example is Microsoft Azure. The customer does not manage any of the infrastructure such as the network, servers, operating system, or storage. Customers choose it because it is a cost-effective and scalable solution that does not need extensive infrastructure and maintenance. SaaS seems to be growing as the world is becoming increasingly more digital and connected.

<b>Spoofing:</b> The purpose of spoofing is to gain unauthorized access, spread malware, or do other malicious activities. Information or identities are falsified to deceive systems, networks, or users. In many cases, faking the sending address of an email is used to gain entry into secure systems. Organizations need to stay vigilant, adopt security best practices to mitigate the impact of spoofing.

<b>State:</b> The current condition or point of time of a system or program. A simple example would be that of a video game character. The state would have information such as location, health, and other attributes.

<b>Subject:</b> An entity that accesses or attempts to access a resource. It could be an individual, process, or device. A common example would be the user attempting to log in acting as a subject.

<b>Symmetric encryption:</b> A type of encryption where an algorithm uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. It is very fast but is more vulnerable than asymmetric encryption.

<b>System Integrity:</b> The quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of a system, network, or software application. The system operates as it should when it doesn’t have anything altering it such as exploited vulnerabilities. Maintaining the CIA (Confidentiality, Integry, Availability) of data and preventing unauthorized access is critical for organizations and requires a comprehensive approach to security and availability.

## T
<b>Technical Controls:</b> Security measures implemented through technology to mitigate risks. There are many different controls based on their functions. Some common controls are firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems, malware protection, security information and event management (SIEM), network segmentation, and patches. These controls when implemented and maintained are critical to the overall security posture for an organization.

<b>Threat:</b> Any potential danger or situation that can exploit vulnerabilities in a system. Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches and disruption of business operations. Mitigating threats is important to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources. Mitigating threats is critical for organizations to ensure that they stay in business and compliant with the laws. Some common threats are malware, phishing, Dos and DDos, APTs, social engineering and insider threats.

<b>Threat Actor:</b> Also known as a Malicious Actor and Adversary. They can be individuals, groups, organizations that seek to exploit vulnerabilities for malicious reasons. They could try to cause harm, gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, knock systems offline to disrupt operations. Understanding the tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) is critical for organizations to mitigate threats by the implementation of cybersecurity strategies. New groups emerge and have different TTPs so constant monitoring for an organization is critical to stay secure.

<b>Threat Vector:</b> The method used by a threat actor to exploit vulnerabilities. The vectors can be traditional methods and also sophisticated depending on the goals of the threat actors. Potential attack paths must be identified so that the best security controls can be implemented. Users are also important because if they are educated, they can avoid common threat vectors. Some common threat vectors are: email based threats, web based threats, network base, and social engineering.

## U
<b>Unix:</b> A powerful operating system originally developed by Bell Labs. It has played a significant role in the modern operating systems and used in software development. It is known for its stability, security features, and its support for many programming languages. Some security features are file permissions, user authentication, and access control mechanisms. Its support for networking protocols and utilities makes it a great choice in networked environments. Its popular variant is Linux. Linux and unix like systems are prevalent in the modern computing landscape. 

<b>User Provisioning:</b> Critical in identity and access management. The process of managing and granting access rights and permissions to individuals. It involves creating, modifying, and deactivating user accounts. It ensures that users have the correct amount of access to resources to do their job. Properly managed access helps reduce security risks and maintain compliance with policies and regulations.

## V
<b>Vulnerability:</b> Refers to a weakness or flaw that can be exploited in order to compromise a system. Vulnerabilities exist in many forms and may lead to data breaches, service disruptions and other potential security incidents. There are four common types to pay attention to. Software vulnerabilities are in apps and operating systems. Network vulnerabilities are in network configurations and protocols. Physical vulnerabilities are weaknesses in physical security. Human vulnerabilities are social engineering and other human errors. Zero-Day vulnerabilities are critical because there are no patches available so they can be exploited by attackers up until a patch is released.

<b>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN):</b> Network segmentation technique that allows administrators to logically divide a physical network into logical groups of workstations, servers, and other devices into the same LAN no matter where they are located. VLANs operate on the second layer of the OSI model and are used for network security, scalability, and manageability. Each VLAN is logically isolated from other VLANs so they cannot communicate unless configured to do so. The isolation improves network security because sensitive devices can be moved to separate VLANs to mitigate breaches. They can be flexible and that is a major advantage in scalability. The broadcast traffic is kept to the VLAN itself so crosstalk is mitigated. The IEEE 802.1 Q standard is most used for VLAN tagging in the Ethernet frames. The tagging allows switches to be able to easily identify which VLAN the traffic belongs to.

## W
<b>Web Server:</b> A device that provides the fundamental World Wide Web (WWW) services on the Internet. Web servers can be used publicly and also internally. If used internally, it is known as an intranet server. It's a software application or hardware that stores, processes, and serves content (web pages, images, and videos). They work together with web browsers for the retrieval and display of web content.

<b>Whaling Attack:</b> A type of cyber attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals in organizations. They can be executives, key decision makers, or highly influential individuals. The attack is sophisticated and aims to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, credentials, financial details or authorizing financial transactions. Implementation of mitigation strategies helps organizations be more resilient against whaling attacks.

<b>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):</b> A type of local area network that uses wireless communications like radio transmissions to connect devices within an area. Common areas are homes, offices, campus, and public hotspots. Since the communications are radio, the connections are flexible and more mobile. A Wi-Fi network is a WLAN.

## Z
<b>Zero Day:</b> A vulnerability in software or system that is exploited by attackers before the software vendor is aware of it. The vulnerability goes without detection or prevention because it does not fit any recognized patterns, signatures, methods, or behaviors. There is no patch available so zero day means that it can be exploited on the same day that it is discovered. The risk associated with zero days is immense, so it is critical for businesses to continuously monitor, update systems, and follow best security practices.

<b>Zero Trust:</b> A security concept and framework that assumes everything cannot be trusted and should always be verified. Implementing zero trust requires a combination of technologies, processes, and a gigantic shift in an organization's culture. Security is managed at each level and with the aim to enhance the overall security posture.
