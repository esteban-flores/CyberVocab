## A

<b>Adequate Security:</b>  means security protections commensurate with the risk resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. This includes ensuring that information hosted on behalf of an agency and information systems and applications used by the agency operate effectively and provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections through the application of cost-effective security controls. Source: OMB Circular A-130

<b>Administrative Controls:</b> Controls implemented through policy and procedures. Examples: access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a specific operation (Dual Control). Administrative controls in modern environments are often enforced in conjunction with physical and/or technical controls, such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and approval by the hiring manager (Restricted Access).

<b>Adverse Events:</b> Events with a negative consequence, such as hacking of systems and data, system crashes, network packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, insider sensitive data theft, execution of malicious code that destroys systems and data.

<b>Application programming interface (API):</b> A way for two software components to communicate using a set of routines, standards, and protocols. Tool for building software applications. 

<b>Application Server:</b> A computer responsible for hosting applications. Source: NIST SP 800-82 Rev.2 

<b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> The ability of computers and robots to simulate human intelligence and behavior.

<b>Asset:</b> Anything of value that is owned by an organization. Assets include information, systems, physical property and intellectual property.

<b>Asymmetric Encryption:</b> An algorithm that uses one key to encrypt and a different key to decrypt input.

<b>Audit:</b> Independent review and examination of records and activities to measure the effectiveness of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures. NIST SP 1800-15B 

<b>Authentication:</b> Access control process validating that the identity being claimed by a user or entity is known to the system, by comparing one (single-factor or SFA) or more (multi-factor authentication or MFA) factors of identification. 

<b>Authorization:</b> The right or a permission that is granted to a system entity to access a system resource. NIST 800-82 Rev.2 

<b>Availability:</b> Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information by authorized users.

## B

<b>Baseline:</b> A documented set of minimum security controls for the lowest level of security configuration allowed by a standard or organization. It helps understand the security posture, security gaps, and cybersecurity regulations.

<b>Biometrics:</b> It is the most accurate and strongest physical security technique for identity verification. Biological characteristics of an individual are unique, such as fingerprints, face, voice, or iris patterns.

<b>Bit:</b> The building block of all digital data. Represents one of two states (zero or one) at Layer 1 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

<b>Bot:</b> Malicious code that acts like a remotely controlled “robot” for an attacker, with other Trojan and worm capabilities.

<b>Breach:</b> Unauthorized access to computer data (PII), applications, networks, or devices. Breaches can occur due to human error, software vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, malware, and social engineering. Source: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 

<b>Broadcast:</b> A packet broadcast is a one-to-many (one-to-everyone) form of internet traffic. The packets are replicated to reach all recipients within a network subnet.

<b>Business Continuity Plan (BCP):</b> The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe how an organization’s mission/business processes will be sustained during and after a significant disruption. The plan should identify the critical assets and functions. The plan should be tested to ensure plan effectiveness during a cyberattack.

<b>Business Impact Analysis (BIA):</b> An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. The BIA quantifies the impacts of disruptions on service delivery, risks to service delivery, and recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). These recovery requirements are then used to develop strategies, solutions, and plans. NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1

<b>Byte:</b> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. A byte can be represented as a character such as a number, letter or symbol.

## C

<b>Ciphertext:</b> The secret altered form of a plaintext. It’s encrypted and unreadable output that is produced by an encryption algorithm. The original data is unreadable by unauthorized users without the appropriate key.

<b>Classification:</b> Classification refers to the process of categorizing and assigning a level of sensitivity or importance to data, systems, or information assets based on their value and the potential impact of their compromise. It is focused on maintaining the confidentiality of the data, based on the data sensitivity.

<b>Classified or Sensitive Information:</b> Information that has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status and classification level when in documentary form. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance and need to know.

<b>Cloud computing:</b> Cloud computing is a technology model that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services, over the internet. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for individuals and organizations by outsourcing computing infrastructure and services to third-party providers.

<b>Confidentiality:</b> Refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. A fundamental aspect of information security, and it is often achieved through encryption, access controls, secure communication channels, and other measures designed to safeguard the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

<b>Community cloud:</b> A type of cloud computing deployment model where computing resources and infrastructure are shared by several organizations with common interests, such as similar security, compliance, or regulatory requirements. It provides a balance between the customization of a private cloud and the shared resources of a public cloud, making it suitable for a specific community or industry.

<b>Configuration management:</b> Organized process of managing and controlling changes to an organization's hardware, software, and network settings. This involves documentation, version control, and monitoring to mitigate vulnerabilities and promptly address unauthorized changes. A process to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated.

<b>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED):</b> Is an approach that seeks to reduce crime and enhance safety by strategically designing the physical environment which emphasizes passive features to discourage criminal activity and promote a sense of security.

<b>Criticality:</b> A measure of how important a system or data is to an organization's mission or business function. The concept of criticality helps prioritize resources and efforts based on the potential impact of a security breach or compromise. Critical systems or assets are those whose compromise could have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive information or overall business operations. 

<b>Cryptanalyst:</b> An expert that analyzes and breaks codes and ciphers used in cryptography. Their work is crucial for both designing secure cryptographic systems and identifying weaknesses in existing ones.

<b>Cryptography:</b> The science and practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes and ciphers. The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data in various communication and storage systems.
