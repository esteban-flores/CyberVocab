<b>Adequate Security:</b>  means security protections commensurate with the risk resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. This includes ensuring that information hosted on behalf of an agency and information systems and applications used by the agency operate effectively and provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections through the application of cost-effective security controls.

<b>Administrative Controls:</b> Controls implemented through policy and procedures. Examples: access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a specific operation (Dual Control). Administrative controls in modern environments are often enforced in conjunction with physical and/or technical controls, such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and approval by the hiring manager (Restricted Access).

<b>Adverse Events:</b> Events with a negative consequence, such as hacking of systems and data, system crashes, network packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, insider sensitive data theft, execution of malicious code that destroys systems and data.

<b>Application programming interface (API):</b> A way for two software components to communicate using a set of routines, standards, and protocols. Tool for building software applications. 

<b>Application Server:</b> A computer responsible for hosting applications. Source: NIST SP 800-82 Rev.2 

<b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> The ability of computers and robots to simulate human intelligence and behavior.

<b>Asset:</b> Anything of value that is owned by an organization. Assets include information, systems, physical property and intellectual property.

<b>Asymmetric Encryption:</b> An algorithm that uses one key to encrypt and a different key to decrypt input.

<b>Audit:</b> Independent review and examination of records and activities to measure the effectiveness of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures. NIST SP 1800-15B 

<b>Authentication:</b> Access control process validating that the identity being claimed by a user or entity is known to the system, by comparing one (single-factor or SFA) or more (multi-factor authentication or MFA) factors of identification. 

<b>Authorization:</b> The right or a permission that is granted to a system entity to access a system resource. NIST 800-82 Rev.2 

<b>Availability:</b> Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information by authorized users.
